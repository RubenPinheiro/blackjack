# blackjack
an console capstone project that replicates the casino game blackjack. The project runs with one player vs the cpu, with the cpu working as the dealer. I'm particularly proud of this project since I was able to singlehandly build the entire logic after lots of debugging and trial-error situations. NOTE: the game is entirely functional, except it doesn't allow the player to split his hand.

SKILLS:
  - debugging
  - walked around with the famous 'developer's high' for a week after completing this one :)
